Aggregate and embed your social media posts on your site (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and many more) as a beautiful social media feed.

== Description ==
Curator.io is a social media aggregator or social media curator – it allows you to specify content sources such as Twitter usernames or Instagram tags. It then pulls this content into a feed or stream that you can curate/manage and embed within your website.

Unlike other social media aggregators Curator.io doesn’t use IFRAMEs. It allows you to embedded the stream as Javascript, HTML & CSS directly into your site where you want it. This means you have full control over how you want the stream to appear and also how it looks. Allowing you to customise it with your sites branding.

The end result is a social media stream that seamlessly integrates into your website.

Currently Curator.io supports Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, Flickr, Vimeo, Yelp, Deviant Art, Slack and RSS. If there is a social media site that you would like us to integrate please, get in touch and we’ll add support as soon as possible.
